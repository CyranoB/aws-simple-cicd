# Installation Guide

## Deploy cross-account IAM role - *This only needs to be done once per account*

If you the accounts are generated using [AWS Landing Zone](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/aws-landing-zone/) or [Control Tower](https://aws.amazon.com/controltower/), then use the cross-account role generated by that service and skip this step.

Modify cross-account/deployment-role.yaml to meet your needs.

```bash
cd cross-account/deployment-role.yaml to meet your needs.
aws cloudformation deploy --template-file cross-account/deployment-role.yaml --stack-name cicd-iam-stack --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```
